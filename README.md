This is a fork of https://github.com/aianlinb/libggpk .

We are using this tool to extract game data such as modifiers.

# Dev Setup
The file oo2core_8_win64.dll is required. We do not provide this file. You can find this DLL in games like Warframe (F2P) and STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order. Simply search for it in the game installation directory and copy it to the same folder as the solution (.sln) file.
